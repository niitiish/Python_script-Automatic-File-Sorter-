# Python_script-Automatic-File-Sorter

//This Script uses the Local Folder link to function//

This Script gets all the files of the local address you have fed into the code and then create Distinct Folders as per the extension of the files.
All the files are then looped one by one and as per their extension, they get moved to their separate folders ; e.g. _.pdf files will get moved to [PDF] folder_
The script is really useful for getting the mess cleaned up from dirty folders having tonnes of files.

The Script uses OS and SHUTIL libraries to function.
In the Script, OS is used to locate the directory on the localdisk and create local directories and folders. 
SHUTIL is used for movement of the files to the new directories made by OS.
